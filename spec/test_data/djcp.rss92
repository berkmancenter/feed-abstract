		<title>S1:E8 &#8211; The Battle</title>
		<description><![CDATA[&#8220;I thought he was going to hurt himself. The Ferengi are mean, but the Ferengi first officer was good because he didn&#8217;t leave the bad guy that wanted revenge in command.  Wesley was funny when he said &#8220;Adults!&#8221;" TNG watches &#8230; <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/djcp/2011/08/s1e8-the-battle/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&#8220;Everybody&#8217;s blonde &#8211; they&#8217;re all way too happy. I bet it will all be an animation. I bet that ship is making the whole planet. It&#8217;s sucking all the data out &#8211; of Data. They wear weird clothes. Eww.

		<title>S1:E5 &#8211; Where No One Has Gone Before</title>
		<description><![CDATA[&#8220;Riker and Troi are friends! The intro to the show takes too long. I like Wesley, even though he&#8217;s a nerd. He&#8217;s a know-it-all but I like him.  Referring to Kosinki, the warp-drive &#8220;consultant&#8221;: Self-confident, self-satisifed pig!

		<title>S1:E4 &#8211; The Last Outpost</title>
		<description><![CDATA[&#8220;It&#8217;s good because it says you shouldn&#8217;t battle each other. Commander Riker is pretty cool in this one. The Ferengi are sort of dumb and mean.  Data is really funny when he gets his fingers caught in the Chinese finger &#8230; <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/djcp/2011/07/s1e4-the-last-outpost/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

		<title>S1:E2 &#8211; The Naked Now</title>
		<description><![CDATA[&#8220;This one sorta creeped me out. It was really weird. Most of them got cuckoo, the Doctor fell in love with the Captain. They get drunk, and even Wes! He takes over the ship, and Riker doesn&#8217;t get drunk, he &#8230; <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/djcp/2011/07/s1e2-the-naked-now/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

		<title>S1:E1 &#8211; Encounter at Farpoint</title>
		<description><![CDATA[&#8220;It has a nice ending. It sorta said SOME true stuff about people, but we&#8217;re a little more advanced than Q thinks we are. This show is weird &#8211; at the end, they figure out that the people in Farpoint &#8230; <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/djcp/2011/07/s1e1-encounter-at-farpoint/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>

		<title>TNG watches TNG</title>
		<description><![CDATA[My daughter knows NOTHING about Star Trek &#8211; she&#8217;s never seen an episode, doesn&#8217;t know what a Klingon or a Vulcan is. She does have the ability to enjoy large, complicated storylines as evidenced by her love of LoTR, Harry &#8230; <a href="http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/djcp/2011/07/tng-watches-tng/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
